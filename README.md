## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **end-to-end data analytics solution** for **Ola’s ride-sharing data**, leveraging **SQL, Excel, and Power BI** to extract insights from a **100,000-row dataset**. The dashboard provides **business intelligence** for analyzing trip patterns, driver performance, customer trends, and revenue metrics.  

## 🔄 Project Workflow  

1. **Data Extraction** → Imported raw ride data from CSV and SQL.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** → Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies using SQL and Excel.  
3. **Data Analysis** → Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.  
4. **Data Visualization** → Created **interactive dashboards in Power BI** for key insights.  
5. **Reporting & Insights** → Generated reports to help Ola optimize business decisions.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  

- **SQL** → Data cleaning, transformation, and querying.  
- **Excel** → Data preprocessing and calculations.  
- **Power BI** → Interactive dashboards and visualizations.  

## 📊 Key Insights  

- **🚗 Peak Ride Hours** → Identified high-demand time slots to optimize driver allocation.
